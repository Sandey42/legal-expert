Multi-Agent RAG System for Legal Contract Analysis
Problem Statement
You are asked to design and implement a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that assists users in querying and analyzing legal contracts.
The system should allow users to ask natural language questions about contracts and receive grounded, precise, and well-cited answers, along with risk indicators where applicable.
The application must run as a console-based interactive system supporting multi-turn conversations.
This is an intentionally open-ended problem. There is no single “correct” architecture. We are interested in your design decisions, trade-offs, and engineering maturity.
Documents Provided
You will be given a small corpus of legal documents, for example:
	•	NDAs
	•	Vendor agreements
	•	Service agreements
	•	Data processing agreements (DPAs)
Each document may contain:
	•	Termination clauses
	•	Confidentiality obligations
	•	Indemnification terms
	•	Liability limits
	•	Governing law
	•	Data breach and compliance clauses
Core Functional Requirements
1. Interactive Console Application
	•	Accept user queries via CLI
	•	Support multi-turn conversation
	•	Maintain conversational context across turns
	•	Display:
	•	Final answer
	•	Referenced document sections or clauses
	•	Risk flags (if applicable)
2. Multi-Agent Architecture
You are expected to design a multi-agent system, where responsibilities are clearly separated.
Agents must be meaningful. Over-agentification without clear responsibility separation will be penalized.
3. RAG Design (Required Choices)
You must clearly define and justify:
a) Document Chunking Strategy
b) Embedding Model
c) LLM Model Choice (via Ollama or OpenAI)
	•	Model name
	•	Prompting strategy per agent
	•	How determinism or verbosity is controlled
d) Retrieval Mechanism
e) Re-ranking (Optional Bonus)
4. Prompt Design
Prompt quality is a major evaluation criterion.
5. Evaluation
You are required to implement at least basic evaluation for your RAG system.
Explain:
	•	What you evaluate
	•	Why it matters
	•	Limitations of your evaluation approach
6. Code Quality & Structure
We expect:
	•	Clean modular structure
	•	Clear separation of concern
	•	Meaningful docstrings and comments
	•	Readable configuration management
Deliverables
1. GitHub Repository
	•	Private repository
	•	master branch with working code
2. README.md (Mandatory)
Must include:
	•	Problem overview
	•	Architecture explanation
	•	Setup instructions
	•	How to run the console app
	•	Design choices and trade-offs
	•	Known limitations
Sample Queries:
Sample Query Set for Evaluation of System
These queries are deliberately crafted to stress different aspects of the system.
	•	“What is the notice period for terminating the NDA?”
	•	“What is the uptime commitment in the SLA?”
	•	“Which law governs the Vendor Services Agreement?”
	•	“Do confidentiality obligations survive termination of the NDA?”
	•	“Is liability capped for breach of confidentiality?”
	•	“What remedies are available if the SLA uptime is not met?”
	•	“Is Vendor XYZ’s liability capped for data breaches?”
	•	“Which agreement governs data breach notification timelines?”
	•	“Are there conflicting governing laws across agreements?”
	•	“Are there any legal risks related to liability exposure?”
	•	“Identify any clauses that could pose financial risk to Acme Corp.”
	•	“Is there any unlimited liability in these agreements?”
	•	“Can Vendor XYZ share Acme’s confidential data with subcontractors?”
	•	“What happens if Vendor delays breach notification beyond 72 hours?”
	•	“Summarize all risks for Acme Corp in one paragraph.”
	•	“Can you draft a better NDA for me?”
	•	“What legal strategy should Acme take against Vendor XYZ?”
Final Interview – Presentation
Prepare a short slide deck covering:
	•	Problem Statement & Requirements
	•	System Architecture
	•	RAG ingestion workflow
	•	Retrieval + agent interaction flow
	•	Design Decisions
	•	Chunking
	•	Embeddings
	•	Retrieval
	•	Agent prompts
	•	Evaluation Approach
	•	Enhancements if This Were Production
